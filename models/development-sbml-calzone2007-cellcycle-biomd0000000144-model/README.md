## Description

This is the Dynamical model of nuclear division cycles during early embryogenesis of Drosophila, without StringT regulation. so ksstg=kdstg=0. Figure1B has been simulated by MathSBML. Curator changed 


## Usage

This model was auto-generated from the biomodels_ebi repository.

```yaml
# In a space.yaml wiring file:
models:
  - repo: Biosimulant/models
    alias: model
    manifest_path: models/development-sbml-calzone2007-cellcycle-biomd0000000144-model/model.yaml
